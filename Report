# Spam_Detector_Machine_learning_project
this project is my first project about "machine learning". it is about detecting spam in back transctions. creditcard.csv this dataset i got from kaggle.
it has 31 features and it has already been done PCA on features because of security reason. first feature of dataset is Time, how long transction take time, others remaning features are v1 to v28, amount which is tell about money involved in each transction, last one is class which label 0 and 1. v1 to v28 are pca values which are not defined vary well because of security reason may be.
process for making ML model for detecting spam or not, for python coding i prefere to work on jupyter notebook IDE, therefore this project created on jupyter notebook. apparently, this dataset has not any missing value and inconsistant value, only it has lot of features which were created by PCA method, i needed to decrease the number of features. therefore, i used embedded feature selection method. iwas enable to get rid of some unimportant features.
